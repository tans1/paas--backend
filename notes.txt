the domain name came to the backend,
    1. create DNS zone and record for both the A root and CNAME for the www and root domain 
    2. update the docker-compose for the specific project
    3. notify the user to update the Nameserver for the domain name 
    
    4. wait till the DNS propagates and then
    5. run the project so that there will be 2 projects running for the project simultaneously until the dns propagates
    6. verify the project is running on the new domain name
    7. notify the user to access the project with the new domain name 
    8. create a new domain name redirection for few days
    9. after scheduled date remove the domain name 
    10. create a new subdomain for the future for another project
